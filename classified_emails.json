Among the predominantly fossil fuel projects on the list were Enbridge's Line 5 oil pipeline under Lake Michigan, several natural gas power plants, and liquefied natural gas export terminals proposed by Cheniere and Venture Global. The Army Corps posted the list, without sending a public notice.READ MORE     Texas GulfLink Deepwater Port Secures MARAD Approval After Multi-Year Review  www.worldoil.com Sentinel Midstream's Texas GulfLink deepwater crude oil export terminal has received its Record of Decision (ROD) from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration approving its deepwater port license application. The ROD concludes a multi-year environmental and technical review of Texas GulfLink’s application during which multiple draft environmental impact statements were published and several public hearings held. The ROD considers the comments of multiple federal and state agencies and thousands more received from the public throughout the review period.READ MORE             U.S. Natural Gas Prices Surge 7% to 25-Month High as Freeze Cuts Output  pgjonline.com U.S. natural gas futures jumped about 7% to a 25-month high on Wednesday as extreme cold in some parts of the country boosted demand for the fuel for heating and cut output by freezing oil and gas wells. Traders said prices also gained support on record gas flows to liquefied natural gas export plants. Front-month gas futures for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 27.3 cents, or 6.8%, to settle at $4.280 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), their highest close since December 2022. That put the contract up for a seventh day in a row for the first time since July 2021 and kept it in technically overbought territory for a second straight day for the first time since November 2024. With gas futures up 29% over the past seven days, stock prices of several of the biggest U.S. gas producers soared. Recent increases in gas prices coupled with a decline in oil futures cut the oil-to-gas ratio.READ MORE     U.S. Oil Industry Braces for More Pain as Inventories Continue To Grow  oilprice.com The American Petroleum Institute (API) estimated that crude oil inventories in the United rose by 3.34 million barrels for the week ending February 14. Analysts had expected a 2.2-million-barrel build. This adds to the almost 18 million barrels of builds in U.S. crude oil inventories during the last four weeks, including a 9 million barrel build in the week prior. Earlier this week, the Department of Energy (DoE) reported that crude oil inventories in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) rose by 0.2 million barrels as of February 14. Inventory levels in the SPR are still hundreds of millions shy of the levels in inventory prior to the SPR withdrawal that took place under the Biden Administration.  At 3:04 pm ET, Brent crude was trading up $0.21 (+0.28%) on the day at $76.05—a $0.90 per barrel dip from this time last week. The U.S. benchmark WTI was trading up on the day by $0.39 (+0.54%) at $72.24—a roughly $1 per barrel decrease.READ MORE                US Regulators Approve Venture Global Increase in Plaquemines LNG Capacity, Exports  boereport.com U.S. federal regulators on Wednesday gave Venture Global LNG permission to increase the export capacity of its Plaquemines, Louisiana, LNG plant. Regulators in a statement said they had approved the plant increasing production capacity to 27.2 million metric tons per year of the superchilled gas, up from 24 million tons. The capacity increase means the second largest LNG exporter in the United States will be able to grow overseas shipments from Plaquemines by about 13%, strengthening the U.S. as the world’s largest exporter of the fuel. Venture Global in January became one of the most valuable U.S. LNG companies when it began trading publicly.29dk2902lVenture told investors last month its strategy is to have extended commissioning periods so it can maximize profits through spot sales at prices higher than it can get under long-term contracts, and to produce at well above the plant’s design capacity to sell excess LNG.READ MORE     RRC Inspectors Investigate Culberson-Reeves Earthquakes  www.mrt.com After one of the largest earthquakes in state history — a 5.0-magnitude earthquake in eastern Culberson County late Feb. 14, it was followed by four others — a 3.8 magnitude and two registering 2.6 magnitude — all within 5 minutes of the 5.0. On the morning of Feb. 18, the area was again struck, this time by a 4.7-magnitude earthquake. In response, the Railroad Commission has sent inspectors to the area to assess the situation as part of its efforts to reduce seismicity possibly caused by underground injection of produced water into disposal wells. “The Railroad Commission is aware of the 5-magnitude earthquake in Reeves County Friday and the 4.7-magnitude earthquake reported Tuesday morning 18 miles away and is in contact with local operators,” Bryce Dubee, agency spokesperson, told the Reporter-Telegram by email. The Northern Culberson-Reeves SRA was one of three the commission established in 2021.READ MORE              What Trends Will Shape Oil and Gas Hiring in 2025?  www.rigzone.com What trends will shape oil and gas hiring in 2025? That was the question Rigzone posed to Dave Mount, Executive Vice President of Louisiana-based OneSource Professional Search, a Xenspire Company, and Brian Binke, the President and CEO of Michigan based the Birmingham Group, an affiliate of Sanford Rose Associates. Responding to the query, Mount told Rigzone that OneSource Professional Search sees “a mixed hiring market in 2025 as several factors play out”. “First the bad news - continuing energy sector M&A activity and larger company staff reductions … will put more qualified people on the street and also accelerate early retirements,” Mount said. Chevron Corporation Vice Chairman Mark Nelson confirmed that the company expects to cut up to 20 percent of its workforce in a statement sent to Rigzone recently by the Chevron team.READ MORE     Latest Oil Market News and Analysis for February 20  www.bloomberg.com Oil wavered after a string of small gains as an industry report flagged another build in US crude stockpiles, while uncertainty over global supplies lingered. Brent crude was little changed near $76 a barrel following a three-day streak of advances. The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute reported a 3.3 million-barrel increase in US commercial inventories last week, the fourth straight build if confirmed by official data later on Thursday. Crude has risen this week on concerns about tighter supply, as OPEC+ mulls whether to push back a production increase and oil flows through a key Kazakh pipeline were reduced. However, trading has calmed after a tumultuous start to the year, with prices locked in a narrow range this month as the market becomes increasingly numb to the array of changes that US President Donald Trump is seeking to implement.READ MORE                    Advertise | Privacy Policy       Association Revenue PartnersA JSJD Media Company500 N.

Thanks in part to history-making performance and record-breaking tax revenue from the Texas oil and natural gas industry, Texas has a $20 billion surplus and is on very sound financial footing as lawmakers get to work for the people of the Lone Star State. That’s good news that hundreds of oil and natural gas workers were proud to share recently at Texas Energy Day at the Capitol in Austin.READ MORE             INDUSTRY NEWS   Fort Worth Firm Sells Permian Basin Assets for $4 Billion  fortworthreport.org In a deal valued at more than $4 billion, Fort Worth-based energy company Double Eagle IV Midco LLC has sold most of its Permian Basin assets to Diamondback Energy Inc. The deal will make Diamondback Energy one of the largest energy companies doing business in the Midland Basin, a subsection of the highly productive Permian Basin which covers parts of West Texas and eastern New Mexico. “We believe our team has built a truly standout asset that further increases Diamondback’s high-quality inventory,” said Cody Campbell and John Sellers, co-chief executive officers of Double Eagle in a statement. “It was important to us that we maintain the stewardship of this asset going forward not only with a world-class Midland operator but also a group that shares our core values and understands the importance of community impact in West Texas.”READ MORE     Trump’s Push for Lower Energy Costs Might Backfire, Experts Warn  www.mrt.com The president has called for increased oil production from U.S. producers and from members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in order to lower energy costs. But that drive for lower prices could have unintended consequences for the industry that wholeheartedly supports him and his energy policies. Bruce Bullock of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University’s Cox School of Business observed that the president made lowering energy prices in order to tame inflation a central theme in his campaign. “However, most of his early actions will tend to put upward pressure on prices. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico, if eventually implemented, would put some pressure on oil prices. Refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will increase oil demand. Imposing tougher sanctions on Iran may well pressure the market upward,” he told the Reporter-Telegram.READ MORE     US Refiners Mull Switch To Alternative Lighter Crudes Amid Trump Tariff Fears  boereport.com Top U.S. refiners are poised to seek alternative sources for heavy, sour crudes, including running more domestic grades, as they await clarity around U.S. President Donald Trump’s threatened tariffs on imports from the nation’s top crude suppliers Canada and Mexico, executives said. Running more domestic crude, which is predominantly light, sweet shale oil, through U.S. refineries could be a win for Trump, who has vowed to boost the nation’s energy production and championed the fossil fuel industry. The tariffs, however, have generated concern among refiners, who are already watching profits slide from record highs in 2022 on softer demand, as they would now take a hit from higher feedstock costs. More than 70% of U.S. processing capacity is configured to run heavier grades, which are cheaper to import from Canada and Mexico.READ MORE                Permian Oil: The Next Four Years  pboilandgasmagazine.com Fourteen years ago, in 2011, I wrote an article for MarketWatch that described how frac’ing for oil and gas would “change everything” for American energy. Among my assertions was the prediction that the United States would be an energy exporter by 2019. The negative comments on the piece were overwhelming. I was told that I was stupid and naive to think that American oil and gas production would surge. Fast forward to 2025 and President Trump has promised to accelerate and expand upon American energy exports. While I applaud the idea, there are certainly some roadblocks to making it happen in practice. Incoming U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent has a goal of increasing U.S. oil production by 3 million barrels per day (bpd). The quickest path to any U.S. increases in oil production run through the Permian Basin, the only American oil basin showing any capacity for real growth in the next four years.READ MORE     Cheniere Plans LNG Expansion Under Trump, CEO Says  pgjonline.com U.S. liquefied natural gas exporter Cheniere Energy plans to aggressively pursue new regulatory permits to expand capacity now that U.S. President Donald Trump is in office, the company's CEO Jack Fusco said on Feb. 20. The approach comes as Cheniere, America's top shipper of the super-chilled fuel, forecast 2025 profits below analyst estimates following a year of moderated prices in the tight global market. \"We intend to strategically pursue permits to ensure the long-term growth optionality of Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi,\" Fusco said, referring to the company's big export terminals. Fusco described the Trump administration's pro-energy policies as refreshing and said Cheniere needs to take the opportunity to secure regulatory certainty. Trump, on his first day in office in January, issued an order to resume processing export permit applications for new LNG projects.READ MORE              EU Seeks More US Gas, Renewable Energy To Replace Russian Supplies  www.reuters.com While Russian pipeline gas deliveries have plunged, the EU increased its imports of Russian liquefied natural gas last year. \"Instead of using taxpayers' money, citizens' money, to pay for gas where the revenue goes into Putin's war chest, we need to make sure that we produce our own energy,\" EU energy commissioner Dan Jorgensen said in a joint media interview, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Jorgensen said Brussels was preparing changes to permit rules to speed up building renewable energy. For industries and home heating where gas cannot be quickly replaced by electricity, he said the EU would step up efforts to source alternative supplies. \"And then it's my job to make sure that it is cheap and not Russian,\" he said. \"There will still be the need for gas, and there we will have to find other sources than Russia, and that can also mean bigger import from the U.S.\"READ MORE     Latest Oil Market News and Analysis for February 21  www.bloomberg.com Oil pared a weekly gain fueled by supply uncertainties as a recovering dollar reduces the appeal of commodities priced in the US currency. Brent slipped below $76 a barrel, with most other raw materials also declining, as a measure of the greenback against major currencies reversed part of its loss on Thursday. Still, oil traders expect OPEC+ to delay a production increase, a drone attack threatened Kazakh pipeline flows and the resumption of exports from Iraq’s Kurdistan region remains unclear. That’s sustaining a 1.4% rise in futures for the week, the biggest since early January. OPEC+ postponing its 120,000 barrel-a-day hike — a move flagged as possible by delegates — would mark the fourth time the group delayed plans to revive production halted since 2022. At present, the alliance aims to restore a total of 2.2 million barrels a day in monthly increments, starting from April.READ MORE                    Advertise | Privacy Policy       Association Revenue PartnersA JSJD Media Company500 N.

Republicans are hoping to highlight President Donald Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda in a hearing this week exploring potential strategies to increase domestic power generation as demands continue to rise. The House Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Energy Policy and Regulatory Affairs, now led by Rep.

nation’s permitting laws. “\r\nREAD MORE

West Texas city of Abilene is better known for country music and rodeos than advanced nuclear physics. But that’s where scientists are entering the final stretch of a race to boot up the next generation of American atomic energy. Amid a flurry of nuclear startups around the country, Abilene-based Natura Resources is one of just two companies with permits from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to construct a so-called “advanced” reactor. It will build its small, one megawatt molten salt reactor beneath a newly-completed laboratory at Abilene Christian University, in an underground trench 25 feet deep and 80 feet long, covered by a concrete lid and serviced by a 40-ton construction crane. Leaders in Texas, the nation’s largest energy producer and consumer, have declared intentions to court the growing nuclear sector and settle it in state.\r\nREAD MORE

centers of the future could pair existing gas generation with wind, solar or battery storage, according to a new analysis, meeting the flood of new electricity demand from the tech industry without damaging grid reliability. Policy experts at RMI, a clean energy think tank, says the “power couples” could help tech companies bring on new data centers faster than waiting in the standard grid interconnection queue. The model would also lower costs by relying on existing grid connections and by offsetting gas-powered generation with cheaper renewables, said Mark Dyson of RMI. Some tech companies and data center developers have pitched either building power-hungry facilities with new power plants or pairing them with existing plants and drawing electricity directly from them. That could help them bypass crowded interconnection queues, but it also risks taking existing power off the grid at a time when\r\ndemand is rising rapidly.\r\nREAD MORE

will sell its interests in the Gulf of Mexico Ursa and Europa fields to Shell for $735 million, both companies confirmed today. ConocoPhillips continues to work towards a strategy of divesting noncore assets, while Shell looks to strengthen its deepwater portfolio. Full-year 2024 production associated with the ConocoPhillips' 15.96% interest in the Ursa Field and 1% interest in the Europa Field was approximately 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed). The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed by the end of second quarter of 2025. “Combined with previously announced dispositions, this transaction reflects our ongoing commitment to further strengthen our portfolio by divesting noncore assets and shows significant progress toward our $2 billion disposition target,” said Andy O’Brien, senior vice president, Strategy, Commercial,\r\nSustainability & Technology at ConocoPhillips.\r\nREAD MORE

Gas Co. will sell all the interests held by its subsidiary in the Eagle Ford shale gas project to Shizuoka Gas Co. for $130 million, the two firms said in a statement on Friday. Japan’s largest gas utility has been under Elliott’s scrutiny since last year, when the activist investor revealed it held a 5% stake in Tokyo Gas and called for it to sell down its multi-billion-dollar real estate portfolio. The company has since said it is considering various measures to unlock value of assets with low capital efficiency, in all areas of its business portfolio. The firm, which acquired a stake in the Eagle Ford project in 2016, will instead focus on assets it gained through the acquisition of Rockcliff Energy in 2023 in East Texas and North Louisiana, according to a statement.  For Shizuoka Gas, the deal will be its first foray into the U.S. market, and comes as the Japanese government makes overtures to\r\nPresident Donald Trump about buying more U.S. energy.\r\nREAD MORE

Sachs said on Friday a proposed 10% U.S. oil tariff could cost foreign producers $10 billion per year, as Canadian and Latin American heavy crudes remain reliant on U.S. refiners due to limited alternative buyers and processing capabilities. President Donald Trump plans to impose a 25% tariff on Mexican crude and a 10% levy on Canadian crude starting in March, a delay from his initial proposal. Despite this, Goldman expects the U.S. to remain the primary destination for heavy crude, as advanced refining capabilities and low costs continue to make American refiners the most competitive buyers. Goldman estimates light oil prices would need to rise by 50 cents per barrel to make medium crude from the Middle East more attractive to Asian refiners, as U.S. Gulf Coast refiners prioritize domestic light crude over imported medium grades.\r\nREAD MORE

fluctuated as the prospect of increased supply from Iraq and uncertainty over President Trump’s plans for tariffs along with efforts to end the three-year war in Ukraine clouded the market outlook. Global benchmark Brent steadied above $74 a barrel after tumbling by 2.7% on Friday, while U.S. marker West Texas Intermediate edged higher after briefly dipping below $70 at the week’s open. Iraq could recommence exports from the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region as early as this week should a pipeline to Turkey resume operations, Iraqi Oil Minister Hayyan Abdul Ghani said Monday. A deputy Iraqi minister said the region may ship 185,000 barrels a day, while the ministry maintained exports will remain within OPEC limits.

He said talks with the U.S. at this stage are aimed at finding common ground, adding that reciprocal tariffs must be made to work for both sides. Sefcovic said Europe needs more energy supplies as it phases out Russian gas, and is a major partner for American liquified natural gas exporters.READ MORE     Oversight Panel Takes up Permitting, Energy Reliability  www.eenews.net House Republicans are hoping to highlight President Donald Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda in a hearing this week exploring potential strategies to increase domestic power generation as demands continue to rise. The House Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Energy Policy and Regulatory Affairs, now led by Rep. Eric Burlison (R-Mo.), will likely focus on Republican-favored baseload generation like oil, natural gas and nuclear through rollbacks of Biden environmental regulations and a streamlining of the nation’s permitting laws. “READ MORE             Texas Wants To Lead Development of New Type of Nuclear Power  www.texastribune.org The West Texas city of Abilene is better known for country music and rodeos than advanced nuclear physics. But that’s where scientists are entering the final stretch of a race to boot up the next generation of American atomic energy. Amid a flurry of nuclear startups around the country, Abilene-based Natura Resources is one of just two companies with permits from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to construct a so-called “advanced” reactor. It will build its small, one megawatt molten salt reactor beneath a newly-completed laboratory at Abilene Christian University, in an underground trench 25 feet deep and 80 feet long, covered by a concrete lid and serviced by a 40-ton construction crane. Leaders in Texas, the nation’s largest energy producer and consumer, have declared intentions to court the growing nuclear sector and settle it in state.READ MORE     ‘Power Couples’ Could Electrify Data Centers and Secure Grid: Analysis  www.eenews.net Data centers of the future could pair existing gas generation with wind, solar or battery storage, according to a new analysis, meeting the flood of new electricity demand from the tech industry without damaging grid reliability. Policy experts at RMI, a clean energy think tank, says the “power couples” could help tech companies bring on new data centers faster than waiting in the standard grid interconnection queue. The model would also lower costs by relying on existing grid connections and by offsetting gas-powered generation with cheaper renewables, said Mark Dyson of RMI. Some tech companies and data center developers have pitched either building power-hungry facilities with new power plants or pairing them with existing plants and drawing electricity directly from them. That could help them bypass crowded interconnection queues, but it also risks taking existing power off the grid at a time when demand is rising rapidly.READ MORE                ConocoPhillips To Sell Interest in Gulf of Mexico Assets to Shell for $735 Million  www.worldoil.com ConocoPhillips will sell its interests in the Gulf of Mexico Ursa and Europa fields to Shell for $735 million, both companies confirmed today. ConocoPhillips continues to work towards a strategy of divesting noncore assets, while Shell looks to strengthen its deepwater portfolio. Full-year 2024 production associated with the ConocoPhillips' 15.96% interest in the Ursa Field and 1% interest in the Europa Field was approximately 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed). The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed by the end of second quarter of 2025. “Combined with previously announced dispositions, this transaction reflects our ongoing commitment to further strengthen our portfolio by divesting noncore assets and shows significant progress toward our $2 billion disposition target,” said Andy O’Brien, senior vice president, Strategy, Commercial, Sustainability & Technology at ConocoPhillips.READ MORE     Tokyo Gas To Sell Stake in Eagle Ford Shale for $130 Million  www.worldoil.com Tokyo Gas Co. will sell all the interests held by its subsidiary in the Eagle Ford shale gas project to Shizuoka Gas Co. for $130 million, the two firms said in a statement on Friday. Japan’s largest gas utility has been under Elliott’s scrutiny since last year, when the activist investor revealed it held a 5% stake in Tokyo Gas and called for it to sell down its multi-billion-dollar real estate portfolio. The company has since said it is considering various measures to unlock value of assets with low capital efficiency, in all areas of its business portfolio. The firm, which acquired a stake in the Eagle Ford project in 2016, will instead focus on assets it gained through the acquisition of Rockcliff Energy in 2023 in East Texas and North Louisiana, according to a statement.  For Shizuoka Gas, the deal will be its first foray into the U.S. market, and comes as the Japanese government makes overtures to President Donald Trump about buying more U.S. energy.READ MORE              Trump’s 10% Oil Tariff Could Cost Foreign Producers $10 Billion Annually, Goldman Sachs Says  boereport.com Goldman Sachs said on Friday a proposed 10% U.S. oil tariff could cost foreign producers $10 billion per year, as Canadian and Latin American heavy crudes remain reliant on U.S. refiners due to limited alternative buyers and processing capabilities. President Donald Trump plans to impose a 25% tariff on Mexican crude and a 10% levy on Canadian crude starting in March, a delay from his initial proposal. Despite this, Goldman expects the U.S. to remain the primary destination for heavy crude, as advanced refining capabilities and low costs continue to make American refiners the most competitive buyers. Goldman estimates light oil prices would need to rise by 50 cents per barrel to make medium crude from the Middle East more attractive to Asian refiners, as U.S. Gulf Coast refiners prioritize domestic light crude over imported medium grades.READ MORE     Latest Oil Prices, Market News and Analysis for Feb. 24  www.bloomberg.com Oil fluctuated as the prospect of increased supply from Iraq and uncertainty over President Trump’s plans for tariffs along with efforts to end the three-year war in Ukraine clouded the market outlook. Global benchmark Brent steadied above $74 a barrel after tumbling by 2.7% on Friday, while U.S. marker West Texas Intermediate edged higher after briefly dipping below $70 at the week’s open. Iraq could recommence exports from the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region as early as this week should a pipeline to Turkey resume operations, Iraqi Oil Minister Hayyan Abdul Ghani said Monday.

He said talks with the U.S. at this stage are aimed at finding common ground, adding that reciprocal tariffs must be made to work for both sides. Sefcovic said Europe needs more energy supplies as it phases out Russian gas, and is a major partner for American liquified natural gas exporters.READ MORE     Oversight Panel Takes up Permitting, Energy Reliability  www.eenews.net House Republicans are hoping to highlight President Donald Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda in a hearing this week exploring potential strategies to increase domestic power generation as demands continue to rise. The House Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Energy Policy and Regulatory Affairs, now led by Rep. Eric Burlison (R-Mo.), will likely focus on Republican-favored baseload generation like oil, natural gas and nuclear through rollbacks of Biden environmental regulations and a streamlining of the nation’s permitting laws. “READ MORE             Texas Wants To Lead Development of New Type of Nuclear Power  www.texastribune.org The West Texas city of Abilene is better known for country music and rodeos than advanced nuclear physics. But that’s where scientists are entering the final stretch of a race to boot up the next generation of American atomic energy. Amid a flurry of nuclear startups around the country, Abilene-based Natura Resources is one of just two companies with permits from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to construct a so-called “advanced” reactor. It will build its small, one megawatt molten salt reactor beneath a newly-completed laboratory at Abilene Christian University, in an underground trench 25 feet deep and 80 feet long, covered by a concrete lid and serviced by a 40-ton construction crane. Leaders in Texas, the nation’s largest energy producer and consumer, have declared intentions to court the growing nuclear sector and settle it in state.READ MORE     ‘Power Couples’ Could Electrify Data Centers and Secure Grid: Analysis  www.eenews.net Data centers of the future could pair existing gas generation with wind, solar or battery storage, according to a new analysis, meeting the flood of new electricity demand from the tech industry without damaging grid reliability. Policy experts at RMI, a clean energy think tank, says the “power couples” could help tech companies bring on new data centers faster than waiting in the standard grid interconnection queue. The model would also lower costs by relying on existing grid connections and by offsetting gas-powered generation with cheaper renewables, said Mark Dyson of RMI. Some tech companies and data center developers have pitched either building power-hungry facilities with new power plants or pairing them with existing plants and drawing electricity directly from them. That could help them bypass crowded interconnection queues, but it also risks taking existing power off the grid at a time when demand is rising rapidly.READ MORE                ConocoPhillips To Sell Interest in Gulf of Mexico Assets to Shell for $735 Million  www.worldoil.com ConocoPhillips will sell its interests in the Gulf of Mexico Ursa and Europa fields to Shell for $735 million, both companies confirmed today. ConocoPhillips continues to work towards a strategy of divesting noncore assets, while Shell looks to strengthen its deepwater portfolio. Full-year 2024 production associated with the ConocoPhillips' 15.96% interest in the Ursa Field and 1% interest in the Europa Field was approximately 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed). The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed by the end of second quarter of 2025. “Combined with previously announced dispositions, this transaction reflects our ongoing commitment to further strengthen our portfolio by divesting noncore assets and shows significant progress toward our $2 billion disposition target,” said Andy O’Brien, senior vice president, Strategy, Commercial, Sustainability & Technology at ConocoPhillips.READ MORE     Tokyo Gas To Sell Stake in Eagle Ford Shale for $130 Million  www.worldoil.com Tokyo Gas Co. will sell all the interests held by its subsidiary in the Eagle Ford shale gas project to Shizuoka Gas Co. for $130 million, the two firms said in a statement on Friday. Japan’s largest gas utility has been under Elliott’s scrutiny since last year, when the activist investor revealed it held a 5% stake in Tokyo Gas and called for it to sell down its multi-billion-dollar real estate portfolio. The company has since said it is considering various measures to unlock value of assets with low capital efficiency, in all areas of its business portfolio. The firm, which acquired a stake in the Eagle Ford project in 2016, will instead focus on assets it gained through the acquisition of Rockcliff Energy in 2023 in East Texas and North Louisiana, according to a statement.  For Shizuoka Gas, the deal will be its first foray into the U.S. market, and comes as the Japanese government makes overtures to President Donald Trump about buying more U.S. energy.READ MORE              Trump’s 10% Oil Tariff Could Cost Foreign Producers $10 Billion Annually, Goldman Sachs Says  boereport.com Goldman Sachs said on Friday a proposed 10% U.S. oil tariff could cost foreign producers $10 billion per year, as Canadian and Latin American heavy crudes remain reliant on U.S. refiners due to limited alternative buyers and processing capabilities. President Donald Trump plans to impose a 25% tariff on Mexican crude and a 10% levy on Canadian crude starting in March, a delay from his initial proposal. Despite this, Goldman expects the U.S. to remain the primary destination for heavy crude, as advanced refining capabilities and low costs continue to make American refiners the most competitive buyers. Goldman estimates light oil prices would need to rise by 50 cents per barrel to make medium crude from the Middle East more attractive to Asian refiners, as U.S. Gulf Coast refiners prioritize domestic light crude over imported medium grades.READ MORE     Latest Oil Prices, Market News and Analysis for Feb. 24  www.bloomberg.com Oil fluctuated as the prospect of increased supply from Iraq and uncertainty over President Trump’s plans for tariffs along with efforts to end the three-year war in Ukraine clouded the market outlook. Global benchmark Brent steadied above $74 a barrel after tumbling by 2.7% on Friday, while U.S. marker West Texas Intermediate edged higher after briefly dipping below $70 at the week’s open. Iraq could recommence exports from the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region as early as this week should a pipeline to Turkey resume operations, Iraqi Oil Minister Hayyan Abdul Ghani said Monday. A deputy Iraqi minister said the region may ship 185,000 barrels a day, while the ministry maintained exports will remain within OPEC limits. Crude has had a bumpy start to 2025 as initial gains unraveled, with prices losing all their year-to-date advances.READ MORE                    Advertise | Privacy Policy       Association Revenue PartnersA JSJD Media Company500 N.

Donald Trump’s recent Executive Order establishing the National Energy Dominance Council marks a critical step towards ensuring America’s energy independence. The Council, chaired by Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and Vice-Chaired by Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, will provide strategic guidance to the President on achieving energy dominance by improving the nation’s energy processes—from permitting and production to distribution and regulation. The Council’s mission is clear: enhance U.S. energy production, cut regulatory red tape, and foster private sector investment in energy innovation. It will work to streamline energy infrastructure projects, boost efficiency, and create policies to support growth in all forms of American energy.\r\nREAD MORE

energy is emerging as a key issue in the Texas Legislature this year, with Sen. Tan Parker introducing a bill aimed at boosting the state’s nuclear energy capacity. SB 1105 would establish the Texas Advanced Nuclear Innovation Fund to subsidize research and investment in nuclear energy technologies. “Texas must lead the way in securing a reliable, long-term energy future, and advanced nuclear technology is a critical part of that vision,” Parker wrote on LinkedIn. Parker’s legislation is part of an ongoing effort by the Texas government to address the reliability issues caused by the increase of intermittent energy on the grid.\r\nREAD MORE

efficiency standards, drinking water infrastructure grants, chemical and waste management programs and even EPA’s statutory authority will all come under the critical eye of Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee this Congress. The panel’s new oversight and authorization plan, which lawmakers will mark up Tuesday, lays out Republicans’ biggest targets for investigations and reform as they move to codify President Donald Trump’s energy and environment goals. It also offers a window into how the GOP will work to hold the Department of Energy, EPA and other agencies under the committee’s jurisdiction accountable after the Biden administration’s historically climate-focused regulatory spree. Democrats on Tuesday will likely object to some of the language in the oversight plan and see proposed amendments rebuffed by the Republican majority.\r\nREAD MORE

of America expects Brent crude to average $75 per barrel in 2025 and $73 in 2026, citing low global oil inventories, balanced supply and demand, and about 5 million barrels per day of OPEC spare production capacity. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, had cut output to keep oil stocks low and set a base price of $70 a barrel, but multiple policy uncertainties on trade, sanctions, foreign affairs and even OPEC+ output are likely to put pressure on oil prices, BofA said. The bank said Brent crude oil is expected to average $60 to $80 a barrel through 2030, maintaining balance in oil markets. Factors such as the use of OPEC+’s spare capacity, a potential peace deal in Ukraine, or a major recession could push oil prices towards the lower end of the range, it added.\r\nREAD MORE

Energy Solutions has completed its previously announced acquisition of Moser Energy Systems. The addition of Moser’s distributed power platform to Atlas’ existing businesses creates a diversified energy solutions provider with a leading portfolio of proppant, logistics (including the Dune Express), and distributed power solutions. The Moser asset base includes a fleet of natural gas-powered generators, expanding Atlas’s current operations into production and distributed power end markets supported by strong macro tailwinds and is expected to reduce through-cycle earnings volatility. “We are very excited to complete the acquisition of Moser, which brings together two innovative companies,” commented John Turner, President and CEO of Atlas. “This acquisition provides Atlas with a new platform for growth, and we believe our shared focus and culture will drive further efficiencies.”\r\nREAD MORE

Tech University's Department of Chemical Engineering received $3.3 million from the U.S. Department of Energy to help recover critical minerals from produced water and bring them into Texas. The grant was given by DOE's Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management in part to help economic growth and job creation in the Gulf Coast and Permian Basin Regions in the state to TTU professor Mahdi Malmali. According to a news release from the university, Malmali said this project will have profound effects on Texas. Malmali said the waste water is costly to dispose of and is often rich with dissolved minerals leaked from subsurface formations. \"Such minerals can potentially unlock the demand for vital materials necessary for the energy transition in the next decades, while reducing our dependency on foreign supplies,\" Malmali said. \"This is a crucial step for the security of energy and defense sectors.”\r\nREAD MORE

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he wanted the Keystone XL Pipeline built and pledged easy regulatory approvals for the project. The pipeline was first proposed in 2008 to bring oil from Canada’s Western tar sands to U.S. refiners and was halted in 2021 by then-owner TC Energy Corp after former Democratic President Joe Biden revoked a key permit needed for a U.S. stretch of the project. In a social media post on Monday, Trump urged the company that was building the pipeline to “come back to America,” saying his administration would offer easy approvals and an almost immediate start. “The Trump Administration is very different (from the Biden administration) – Easy approvals, almost immediate start! If not them, perhaps another Pipeline Company. We want the Keystone XL Pipeline built,” Trump said in the post.\r\nREAD MORE

steadied near $75 a barrel after the U.S. issued fresh sanctions on Iran, and President Donald Trump signaled tariffs against Canada and Mexico were still on the cards. Brent edged up as much as 0.6%, before paring gains, following a small increase on Monday. The U.S. slapped more curbs on brokers, vessels and individuals that it said were linked to illicit shipments of Iranian crude. At the same time, levies set to hit the U.S.’s two neighbors were “on time” to be implemented next month, Trump told a press conference. Canada and Mexico are America’s top foreign crude suppliers and major trade partners. Crude has had a rocky start to the year, first rising on cold weather and an earlier round of sanctions from the U.S., then retracing gains after Trump took office and initiated plans for tariffs that could impact global growth and demand. The levies on the North American neighbors, however, may also\r\nimpact supplies.\r\nREAD MORE

The Council, chaired by Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and Vice-Chaired by Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, will provide strategic guidance to the President on achieving energy dominance by improving the nation’s energy processes—from permitting and production to distribution and regulation. The Council’s mission is clear: enhance U.S. energy production, cut regulatory red tape, and foster private sector investment in energy innovation. It will work to streamline energy infrastructure projects, boost efficiency, and create policies to support growth in all forms of American energy.READ MORE     Texas Legislature Pushing for Increased Nuclear Energy Investment  lonestarstandard.com Nuclear energy is emerging as a key issue in the Texas Legislature this year, with Sen. Tan Parker introducing a bill aimed at boosting the state’s nuclear energy capacity. SB 1105 would establish the Texas Advanced Nuclear Innovation Fund to subsidize research and investment in nuclear energy technologies. “Texas must lead the way in securing a reliable, long-term energy future, and advanced nuclear technology is a critical part of that vision,” Parker wrote on LinkedIn. Parker’s legislation is part of an ongoing effort by the Texas government to address the reliability issues caused by the increase of intermittent energy on the grid.READ MORE             Energy and Commerce GOP Lays Out Oversight Targets  www.eenews.net Energy efficiency standards, drinking water infrastructure grants, chemical and waste management programs and even EPA’s statutory authority will all come under the critical eye of Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee this Congress. The panel’s new oversight and authorization plan, which lawmakers will mark up Tuesday, lays out Republicans’ biggest targets for investigations and reform as they move to codify President Donald Trump’s energy and environment goals. It also offers a window into how the GOP will work to hold the Department of Energy, EPA and other agencies under the committee’s jurisdiction accountable after the Biden administration’s historically climate-focused regulatory spree. Democrats on Tuesday will likely object to some of the language in the oversight plan and see proposed amendments rebuffed by the Republican majority.READ MORE     Bank of America Predicts Brent Crude To Average $75/bbl in 2025  boereport.com Bank of America expects Brent crude to average $75 per barrel in 2025 and $73 in 2026, citing low global oil inventories, balanced supply and demand, and about 5 million barrels per day of OPEC spare production capacity. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, had cut output to keep oil stocks low and set a base price of $70 a barrel, but multiple policy uncertainties on trade, sanctions, foreign affairs and even OPEC+ output are likely to put pressure on oil prices, BofA said. The bank said Brent crude oil is expected to average $60 to $80 a barrel through 2030, maintaining balance in oil markets. Factors such as the use of OPEC+’s spare capacity, a potential peace deal in Ukraine, or a major recession could push oil prices towards the lower end of the range, it added.READ MORE                Atlas Energy Acquires Moser Energy, Improving Logistics Solutions Through Permian  www.worldoil.com Atlas Energy Solutions has completed its previously announced acquisition of Moser Energy Systems. The addition of Moser’s distributed power platform to Atlas’ existing businesses creates a diversified energy solutions provider with a leading portfolio of proppant, logistics (including the Dune Express), and distributed power solutions. The Moser asset base includes a fleet of natural gas-powered generators, expanding Atlas’s current operations into production and distributed power end markets supported by strong macro tailwinds and is expected to reduce through-cycle earnings volatility. “We are very excited to complete the acquisition of Moser, which brings together two innovative companies,” commented John Turner, President and CEO of Atlas. “This acquisition provides Atlas with a new platform for growth, and we believe our shared focus and culture will drive further efficiencies.”READ MORE     Texas Tech Receives Funds From DOE for Critical Minerals Assessment  www.lubbockonline.com Texas Tech University's Department of Chemical Engineering received $3.3 million from the U.S. Department of Energy to help recover critical minerals from produced water and bring them into Texas. The grant was given by DOE's Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management in part to help economic growth and job creation in the Gulf Coast and Permian Basin Regions in the state to TTU professor Mahdi Malmali. According to a news release from the university, Malmali said this project will have profound effects on Texas. Malmali said the waste water is costly to dispose of and is often rich with dissolved minerals leaked from subsurface formations. \"Such minerals can potentially unlock the demand for vital materials necessary for the energy transition in the next decades, while reducing our dependency on foreign supplies,\" Malmali said. \"This is a crucial step for the security of energy and defense sectors.”READ MORE              Trump Says He Wants Keystone XL Pipeline To Be Built  boereport.com Republican U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he wanted the Keystone XL Pipeline built and pledged easy regulatory approvals for the project. The pipeline was first proposed in 2008 to bring oil from Canada’s Western tar sands to U.S. refiners and was halted in 2021 by then-owner TC Energy Corp after former Democratic President Joe Biden revoked a key permit needed for a U.S. stretch of the project. In a social media post on Monday, Trump urged the company that was building the pipeline to “come back to America,” saying his administration would offer easy approvals and an almost immediate start. “The Trump Administration is very different (from the Biden administration) – Easy approvals, almost immediate start! If not them, perhaps another Pipeline Company. We want the Keystone XL Pipeline built,” Trump said in the post.READ MORE     Latest Oil Market News and Analysis for February 25  www.bloomberg.com Oil steadied near $75 a barrel after the U.S. issued fresh sanctions on Iran, and President Donald Trump signaled tariffs against Canada and Mexico were still on the cards. Brent edged up as much as 0.6%, before paring gains, following a small increase on Monday. The U.S. slapped more curbs on brokers, vessels and individuals that it said were linked to illicit shipments of Iranian crude. At the same time, levies set to hit the U.S.’s two neighbors were “on time” to be implemented next month, Trump told a press conference. Canada and Mexico are America’s top foreign crude suppliers and major trade partners. Crude has had a rocky start to the year, first rising on cold weather and an earlier round of sanctions from the U.S., then retracing gains after Trump took office and initiated plans for tariffs that could impact global growth and demand. The levies on the North American neighbors, however, may also impact supplies.READ MORE                    Advertise | Privacy Policy       Association Revenue PartnersA JSJD Media Company500 N.

SB 1105 would establish the Texas Advanced Nuclear Innovation Fund to subsidize research and investment in nuclear energy technologies. “Texas must lead the way in securing a reliable, long-term energy future, and advanced nuclear technology is a critical part of that vision,” Parker wrote on LinkedIn. Parker’s legislation is part of an ongoing effort by the Texas government to address the reliability issues caused by the increase of intermittent energy on the grid.READ MORE             Energy and Commerce GOP Lays Out Oversight Targets  www.eenews.net Energy efficiency standards, drinking water infrastructure grants, chemical and waste management programs and even EPA’s statutory authority will all come under the critical eye of Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee this Congress. The panel’s new oversight and authorization plan, which lawmakers will mark up Tuesday, lays out Republicans’ biggest targets for investigations and reform as they move to codify President Donald Trump’s energy and environment goals. It also offers a window into how the GOP will work to hold the Department of Energy, EPA and other agencies under the committee’s jurisdiction accountable after the Biden administration’s historically climate-focused regulatory spree. Democrats on Tuesday will likely object to some of the language in the oversight plan and see proposed amendments rebuffed by the Republican majority.READ MORE     Bank of America Predicts Brent Crude To Average $75/bbl in 2025  boereport.com Bank of America expects Brent crude to average $75 per barrel in 2025 and $73 in 2026, citing low global oil inventories, balanced supply and demand, and about 5 million barrels per day of OPEC spare production capacity. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, had cut output to keep oil stocks low and set a base price of $70 a barrel, but multiple policy uncertainties on trade, sanctions, foreign affairs and even OPEC+ output are likely to put pressure on oil prices, BofA said. The bank said Brent crude oil is expected to average $60 to $80 a barrel through 2030, maintaining balance in oil markets. Factors such as the use of OPEC+’s spare capacity, a potential peace deal in Ukraine, or a major recession could push oil prices towards the lower end of the range, it added.READ MORE                Atlas Energy Acquires Moser Energy, Improving Logistics Solutions Through Permian  www.worldoil.com Atlas Energy Solutions has completed its previously announced acquisition of Moser Energy Systems. The addition of Moser’s distributed power platform to Atlas’ existing businesses creates a diversified energy solutions provider with a leading portfolio of proppant, logistics (including the Dune Express), and distributed power solutions. The Moser asset base includes a fleet of natural gas-powered generators, expanding Atlas’s current operations into production and distributed power end markets supported by strong macro tailwinds and is expected to reduce through-cycle earnings volatility. “We are very excited to complete the acquisition of Moser, which brings together two innovative companies,” commented John Turner, President and CEO of Atlas. “This acquisition provides Atlas with a new platform for growth, and we believe our shared focus and culture will drive further efficiencies.”READ MORE     Texas Tech Receives Funds From DOE for Critical Minerals Assessment  www.lubbockonline.com Texas Tech University's Department of Chemical Engineering received $3.3 million from the U.S. Department of Energy to help recover critical minerals from produced water and bring them into Texas. The grant was given by DOE's Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management in part to help economic growth and job creation in the Gulf Coast and Permian Basin Regions in the state to TTU professor Mahdi Malmali. According to a news release from the university, Malmali said this project will have profound effects on Texas. Malmali said the waste water is costly to dispose of and is often rich with dissolved minerals leaked from subsurface formations. \"Such minerals can potentially unlock the demand for vital materials necessary for the energy transition in the next decades, while reducing our dependency on foreign supplies,\" Malmali said. \"This is a crucial step for the security of energy and defense sectors.”READ MORE              Trump Says He Wants Keystone XL Pipeline To Be Built  boereport.com Republican U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he wanted the Keystone XL Pipeline built and pledged easy regulatory approvals for the project. The pipeline was first proposed in 2008 to bring oil from Canada’s Western tar sands to U.S. refiners and was halted in 2021 by then-owner TC Energy Corp after former Democratic President Joe Biden revoked a key permit needed for a U.S. stretch of the project. In a social media post on Monday, Trump urged the company that was building the pipeline to “come back to America,” saying his administration would offer easy approvals and an almost immediate start. “The Trump Administration is very different (from the Biden administration) – Easy approvals, almost immediate start! If not them, perhaps another Pipeline Company. We want the Keystone XL Pipeline built,” Trump said in the post.READ MORE     Latest Oil Market News and Analysis for February 25  www.bloomberg.com Oil steadied near $75 a barrel after the U.S. issued fresh sanctions on Iran, and President Donald Trump signaled tariffs against Canada and Mexico were still on the cards. Brent edged up as much as 0.6%, before paring gains, following a small increase on Monday. The U.S. slapped more curbs on brokers, vessels and individuals that it said were linked to illicit shipments of Iranian crude. At the same time, levies set to hit the U.S.’s two neighbors were “on time” to be implemented next month, Trump told a press conference. Canada and Mexico are America’s top foreign crude suppliers and major trade partners. Crude has had a rocky start to the year, first rising on cold weather and an earlier round of sanctions from the U.S., then retracing gains after Trump took office and initiated plans for tariffs that could impact global growth and demand. The levies on the North American neighbors, however, may also impact supplies.READ MORE                    Advertise | Privacy Policy       Association Revenue PartnersA JSJD Media Company500 N.

The museum was recognized with the prestigious honor last October during a ceremony at the White House. The Medal is the highest honor in the arts given by the United States government. Kyle Young, CEO of the museum, gathered staff in the Ford Theater to thank them for their contributions and acknowledge the many individuals and entities who supported the museum’s educational mission through the years. He also shared his experience accepting the honor on behalf of the institution. Following a staff photo, the newly engraved Medal was placed on display in the museum’s galleries along with the accompanying White House Citation. The Citation recognized the museum \"for cataloguing one of the nation’s great homegrown art forms\" and for its enduring work, which \"preserves history, honors giants of the genre and inspires future generations to write their own songs about the American story.\" The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum was named among 20 National Medal of Arts recipients representing 2022 and 2023. Primarily awarded to individuals, the museum was the only institution included among the new recipients. Established by Congress in 1984, the Medal is awarded to individuals or groups who are \"deserving of special recognition by reason of their outstanding contributions to the excellence, growth, support and availability of the arts in the United States.\" FOR MEDIA: Download photos of the event and Medal on display (Photos courtesy of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum) ### Contact: Jeremy Rush – jrush@countrymusichalloffame.orgMedia Website: http://countrymusichalloffame.org/press About the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum: The Country Music Hall of Fame® and Museum collects, preserves and interprets country music and its history for the education and entertainment of diverse audiences.

RACHEL HAKIMIAN EMENAKERDEEP ROOTS AMONG FALLEN TREESOPENING RECEPTIONSAT. MARCH 1 from 7 - 10PM  RACHEL HAKIMIAN EMENAKERDEEP ROOTS AMONG FALLEN TREESMarch 1 - May 11, 2025OPENING RECEPTIONSaturday, March 17:00 - 10:00PMAt the intersection of globalization, migration, and memory, Deep Roots Among Fallen Trees offers a reflection on architecture as a space where loss and regeneration coexist, where memory is both preserved and erased. This installation delves into how diasporic communities continue to develop complex cultural landscapes despite being torn from their roots, forging new identities and histories through the fusion of old and new, memory and materiality. It explores how ancestral knowledge endures, not as a static inheritance, but as a living process shaped by displacement, resilience, and the passage of time. In tracing these shifts, Rachel Hakimian Emenaker reveals architecture as more than a physical structure; it becomes a vessel of cultural continuity and reinvention across generations.ABOUT THE ARTISTRachel Hakimian Emenaker is an Armenian-American artist raised between Paramaribo, Suriname, and Moscow, Russia. She received her MFA from UCLA in 2024. Drawing from Eastern and Western art and craft practices, she explores materials with histories of commodification along global trade routes, blending them to examine geopolitics, globalization, erasure, and cultural memory. Through installations, she reimagines architecture as a symbolic space where histories collide, languages and identities engage, and migration and erasure intersect. She seeks to uncover and reimagine what has been lost, erased, or forgotten, preserving diasporic memory through her work.CURATORThis exhibition is curated by Savannah Lee, GCAC Curatorial Associate.EXHIBITION LINK JENNIFER REEDERNEVERMINDOPENING RECEPTIONSAT. MARCH 1 from 7 - 10PM Jennifer Reeder, Nevermind, 1998  Single channel video projection, color, sound, duration: 18 minutes. JENNIFER REEDERNEVERMINDMarch 1 - May 11, 2025OPENING RECEPTIONSaturday, March 17:00 - 10:00PMNevermind is a non-narrative post-punk aria, one in Jennifer Reeder's three-part video series significantly inspired by Steina and Woody Vasulka's Let it Be (video, 1970). This project is about the manifestation of gender and rebellion in media culture. It threatens the power of the hero in Rock music and features the artist lip-syncing to Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit.ABOUT THE ARTIST Bong Joon Ho recently named Jennifer Reeder, “a filmmaker to watch in the 2020s.” She constructs nuanced genre films about relationships, trauma, and coping that borrows from various forms, including after-school specials and amateur music videos, and could be classified as NOIR CAMP. These films have been screened and exhibited at festivals and museums worldwide, including Sundance, Berlin, Rotterdam, SXSW, Tribeca, BFI-London Film Festival, The Whitney Biennial, and the Venice Biennale. She received the 2024 Tour De Force Award from the Chicago International Film Festival and is a Creative Capital grantee.EXHIBITION LINK CONTINUING EXHIBITIONDINO PEREZ: BAILE / CAILE   DINO PEREZBAILE / CAILEthrough May 11, 2025In the 1980s and 1990s, many families migrated from Mexico to Orange County, California, particularly Anaheim and Santa Ana. These cities became hubs where immigrant communities, including the artist’s family, found belonging and built new lives. As a first-generation Latinx growing up in this environment, artist Dino Perez witnessed how stories of parents’ lives in Mexico intertwined with the shared experiences of navigating a new culture and identity.Immigrant parents made immense sacrifices to come to this country, driven by the hope of providing better opportunities for their children. For their first-generation kids, this often translated into the pressure to excel academically and pursue esteemed professions like medicine or law. Amidst these expectations, these youth were also teenagers who sought joy, connection, and release. For many, dancing became that outlet—a form of escapism where one could momentarily shed the weight of expectations and revel in the present.EXHIBITION LINK GCACIN THE PRESS  EAST OF BORNEOARTISTS AT WORK: ROKSANA PIROUZMANDby MICHAEL NED HOLTEOur sincere thanks to East of Borneo, artist Roksana Pirousmand, and writer Michael Ned Holte for including a mention and images from our 2021 solo exhibition Roksana Pirouzmand: They Last Forever in the January issue of East of Borneo..Please take a moment to read the article / interview..EAST OF BORNEO LINK RYMAN ARTSFREE DRAWING WORKSHOP@ GCAC RYMAN ARTSFREE DRAWING WORKSHOP FORSANTA ANA STUDENTS GRADES 8-11APRIL 15 - MAY 13SIGN-UP REQUIREDJoin Ryman Arts, in collaboration with Grand Central Art Center, for a free after-school drawing workshop this spring.

Hinkle and Tyler Matthew Oyer performing Exploring the Nowannago: Kentifrican Modes of Resistance at CSUF Grand Central Art Center, Santa Ana.  Video documentation by Chris Wormald A LOOK BACKSATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 2016KENYATTA A.C. HINKLE and TYLER MATTHEW OYEREXPLORING THE NOWANNAGO: KENTIFRICAN MODES OF RESISTANCE Navigating the Historical Present is a mantra for artist Kenyatta A.C. Hinkle’s practice in which she creates performative situations to illustrate how she grapples with the residue of history related to the context of exploring the exotification and exploitation of the Black female body. Within her Kentifrica Project, Hinkle conducted extensive research and recreated an artifact called the Nowannago to be used as a symbol of navigating the historical present. The Nowannago is akin to the Oroborus, the serpent that eats its tail within ancient Egyptian mythology. The fight with time, spatiality, and social dynamics creates a never-ending cycle in which oppositional parties have to grapple with their issues.The exhibition Exploring The Nowannago: Kentifrican Modes of Resistance  served as an ongoing stage and installation for video and performance featuring Kenyatta A.C. Hinkle and Tyler Matthew Oyer. This body of work involved a Kentifrican narrative that provided a social critique of how we are chained to the residue of the past and how bodies that are deemed “other” through labels of queerness, racial constructions, and gender constructions are treated.A tug of war ensued during the performance in which the Nowannago was used to illustrate the complex push and pull of realities within historical and contemporary hegemonic impulses that seek to condemn bodies that are misunderstood. The Nowannago, the double noose, is an instrument integral to Kentifrican presence in relationship to encounters with cultures that were intrusive and different from their own. The double noose was used as a forced mating ritual between a British or Portuguese trader and a Kentifrican woman. Kentifrica, as geography, has never been formally colonized. Due to a deadly poisonous plant called the Yahwaseen located on the coast of West Kentifrica, discovery was limited to a few small nearly visible ports along the northern and eastern coasts. It was near these ports that Kentifrican individuals found themselves abducted to be a part of the slave trade and brought to North and South America. The noose became known as a Nowannago from few witnesses who managed to escape the deadly game.EXHIBITION AND PERFORMANCE WEBSITE  YOUR GENEROUS DONATIONS HELP MAKE OUR 2025PROGRAMS AND RESIDENCIES POSSIBLE PLEASE SUPPORTGCAC TODAY!

week, U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled the National Energy Dominance Council that is tasked with enhancing America’s energy security and cutting reliance on foreign entities. According to a White House statement, the Biden-Harris Administration dramatically slowed the growth rate of American energy production and development, including by instituting a federal oil leasing moratorium and removing hundreds of million acres from being available for energy production. Trump’s White House claims that over the past four years, it is estimated that the U.S. produced over two billion fewer barrels of oil than anticipated by trend (had President Trump’s energy policies been kept intact).\r\nREAD MORE

Energy’s large generators, heavily criticized for being useless in the aftermath of Hurricane Beryl, will be shipped to San Antonio for up to two years to manage grid bottlenecks in that region. Once those generators are donated to San Antonio sometime this summer, CenterPoint will no longer charge its customers for those units idling on standby in the Houston region. The average customer can expect a $2 per month bill reduction by 2027, CenterPoint said in a Tuesday night statement. Instead, the large generators will be used to help alleviate a recurring grid chokepoint in the San Antonio area that could trigger rotating blackouts if left unaddressed, according to a proposal approved Tuesday by the ERCOT.\r\nREAD MORE

American Petroleum Institute trade group on Monday pressed for a nationwide policy on higher-ethanol blends of gasoline after President Donald Trump's administration said on Friday it would move ahead with expanded sales of the product in certain Midwestern states. The EPA said on Feb. 21 it would uphold an April 28 implementation date for a request from eight Midwest governors to allow year-round sales of gasoline containing 15% ethanol, a blend known as E15. The EPA's action is meant to enable both E15 and the more widely available E10 fuel blends to be sold during the summer, where the existing policy often keeps E15 out of the market. While biofuel producers have long wanted expanded sales of the E15 blend, they would prefer a nationwide solution. The API also prefers a nationwide policy, as some industry players worry a fragmented market could lead to localized supply disruptions.\r\nREAD MORE

American energy industry has always taken great pride in being innovative, independent, and committed to free market principles. Recently, however, executives at some of the nation’s biggest oil and gas companies are publicly embracing the same corporate welfare schemes that have propped up unreliable so-called “green” energy for decades. This is discouraging because government subsidies distort markets, encourage dependency, and waste taxpayer dollars, whether they are handed to wind farms or carbon capture projects. As an energy regulator, my position is simple: I am agnostic on technological innovation, but I am categorically opposed to corporate welfare for energy production. I oppose it for “green” energy, and I oppose it for oil and gas. Why? Because I am not a hypocrite. If a technology is viable, it shouldn’t need subsidies; and if it needs subsidies, it is not viable.\r\nREAD MORE

Petroleum generated $4.9 billion of free cash flow in 2024, paid about $800 million of common dividends and increased its quarterly dividend by more than 22%. In her fourth quarter earnings call, President-CEO Vicki A. Hollub said that her company achieved its near-term debt repayment target of $4.5 billion 7 months ahead of schedule. “The combination of execution efficiencies along with strong new well deliverability and enhanced base production enabled us to achieve the highest annual U.S. oil production as well as record total company production at 1.33 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2024,” Hollub said.

Energy Inc. is in talks to form a power joint venture that would solve some of the shale giant’s own needs in the Permian Basin while also selling electricity to artificial intelligence data centers in West Texas. Diamondback says it’s looking for an equity stake in a gas-fired power plant that would be built on some of its 65,000 surface acreage to supply electricity primarily to data centers. The biggest independent oil producer in the world’s busiest shale patch detailed plans to investors on Tuesday. “There’s been a lot of discussions around power,” President Kaes Van’t Hof said on the call. “Obviously, we’re short power in the basin.” It’s the latest iteration of a Permian producer looking to cash in on the expected boom in data center development in Texas and the rest of the US. Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. have also announced interest in recent months for supplying power in\r\nvarious arrangements for AI data centers.\r\nREAD MORE

66 is expanding its methane detection efforts by deploying Bridger Photonics’ aerial monitoring technology across its entire midstream network. The move is part of the company’s broader push to reduce emissions, going beyond current regulatory requirements. Bridger will conduct aerial scans twice a year using its Gas Mapping LiDAR technology to detect methane leaks. The company’s sensors provide precise data on emissions, helping operators like Phillips 66 identify leaks, address equipment issues, and improve infrastructure. Bridger, which monitors over 200,000 miles of pipeline and gathering infrastructure, is a key player in emissions detection. More than half of the top ten U.S. midstream operators use its technology to manage methane emissions. Phillips 66, now one of the largest natural gas processors in the U.S. following its increased stake in DCP Midstream in 2023, has made emissions\r\nreduction a priority.\r\nREAD MORE

demand for liquefied natural gas is estimated to rise by around 60% by 2040, driven largely by economic growth in Asia, AI impact and efforts to cut emissions in heavy industries and transportation, Shell said in an annual report on Tuesday. Demand for natural gas continues to rise globally as the world transitions to cleaner fuels. Industry forecasts LNG demand to reach between 630 million and 718 million metric tons a year by 2040, Shell said in its 2025 annual LNG outlook. The latest view from the world's largest LNG trader is higher than last year's forecast, which pegged global LNG demand in 2040 at 625 million to 685 million tons per year. \"Upgraded forecasts show that the world will need more gas for power generation, heating and cooling, industry and transport to meet development and decarbonization goals,\" said Tom Summers, Shell's senior vice president for LNG marketing and trading.\r\nREAD MORE

in New York steadied after sinking back into the $60s as a souring economic outlook threatened prospects for energy demand and spurred investors to shun riskier assets. WTI futures traded near $69 a barrel, after slumping 2.5% on Tuesday for the lowest close this year. A poor reading of US consumer confidence fanned concerns over the impact of President Trump’s tariffs. Crude has lost almost 5% this month as Trump’s aggressive moves on trade stoked investor anxiety at a time when oil traders were already concerned about lackluster consumption in China. Supply issues have also been at the fore, including the possibility of a restart of significant pipeline flows from Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, with the US pushing for a resumption. “Trump actions are hurting consumer and business confidence, which again will weaken actual consumption,” said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at\r\nSEB AB.\r\nREAD MORE

According to a White House statement, the Biden-Harris Administration dramatically slowed the growth rate of American energy production and development, including by instituting a federal oil leasing moratorium and removing hundreds of million acres from being available for energy production. Trump’s White House claims that over the past four years, it is estimated that the U.S. produced over two billion fewer barrels of oil than anticipated by trend (had President Trump’s energy policies been kept intact).READ MORE     ERCOT Approves Plan To Send Centerpoint Generators to San Antonio  www.houstonchronicle.com CenterPoint Energy’s large generators, heavily criticized for being useless in the aftermath of Hurricane Beryl, will be shipped to San Antonio for up to two years to manage grid bottlenecks in that region. Once those generators are donated to San Antonio sometime this summer, CenterPoint will no longer charge its customers for those units idling on standby in the Houston region. The average customer can expect a $2 per month bill reduction by 2027, CenterPoint said in a Tuesday night statement.

The EPA said on Feb. 21 it would uphold an April 28 implementation date for a request from eight Midwest governors to allow year-round sales of gasoline containing 15% ethanol, a blend known as E15. The EPA's action is meant to enable both E15 and the more widely available E10 fuel blends to be sold during the summer, where the existing policy often keeps E15 out of the market. While biofuel producers have long wanted expanded sales of the E15 blend, they would prefer a nationwide solution. The API also prefers a nationwide policy, as some industry players worry a fragmented market could lead to localized supply disruptions.READ MORE     Op-Ed: Dear DOGE: It’s Time To End Energy Subsidies  www.worldoil.com The American energy industry has always taken great pride in being innovative, independent, and committed to free market principles. Recently, however, executives at some of the nation’s biggest oil and gas companies are publicly embracing the same corporate welfare schemes that have propped up unreliable so-called “green” energy for decades. This is discouraging because government subsidies distort markets, encourage dependency, and waste taxpayer dollars, whether they are handed to wind farms or carbon capture projects. As an energy regulator, my position is simple: I am agnostic on technological innovation, but I am categorically opposed to corporate welfare for energy production. I oppose it for “green” energy, and I oppose it for oil and gas. Why? Because I am not a hypocrite. If a technology is viable, it shouldn’t need subsidies; and if it needs subsidies, it is not viable.READ MORE                Oxy Starts New Year After Banner 2024  www.oaoa.com Occidental Petroleum generated $4.9 billion of free cash flow in 2024, paid about $800 million of common dividends and increased its quarterly dividend by more than 22%. In her fourth quarter earnings call, President-CEO Vicki A. Hollub said that her company achieved its near-term debt repayment target of $4.5 billion 7 months ahead of schedule. “The combination of execution efficiencies along with strong new well deliverability and enhanced base production enabled us to achieve the highest annual U.S. oil production as well as record total company production at 1.33 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2024,” Hollub said. Aside from debt reduction, Hollub added that Oxy’s priority is to advance its major projects safely and reliably, bringing STRATOS online this year and keeping the Battleground chemical plant modernization and expansion project east of Houston on track for completion next year.READ MORE     Diamondback Pursues JV for Gas-Fueled Plants To Power Permian Data Centers  www.worldoil.com Diamondback Energy Inc. is in talks to form a power joint venture that would solve some of the shale giant’s own needs in the Permian Basin while also selling electricity to artificial intelligence data centers in West Texas. Diamondback says it’s looking for an equity stake in a gas-fired power plant that would be built on some of its 65,000 surface acreage to supply electricity primarily to data centers. The biggest independent oil producer in the world’s busiest shale patch detailed plans to investors on Tuesday. “There’s been a lot of discussions around power,” President Kaes Van’t Hof said on the call. “Obviously, we’re short power in the basin.” It’s the latest iteration of a Permian producer looking to cash in on the expected boom in data center development in Texas and the rest of the US. Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. have also announced interest in recent months for supplying power in various arrangements for AI data centers.READ MORE     Phillips 66 Expands Aerial Methane Detection With Bridger Photonics  pgjonline.com Phillips 66 is expanding its methane detection efforts by deploying Bridger Photonics’ aerial monitoring technology across its entire midstream network. The move is part of the company’s broader push to reduce emissions, going beyond current regulatory requirements. Bridger will conduct aerial scans twice a year using its Gas Mapping LiDAR technology to detect methane leaks. The company’s sensors provide precise data on emissions, helping operators like Phillips 66 identify leaks, address equipment issues, and improve infrastructure. Bridger, which monitors over 200,000 miles of pipeline and gathering infrastructure, is a key player in emissions detection. More than half of the top ten U.S. midstream operators use its technology to manage methane emissions. Phillips 66, now one of the largest natural gas processors in the U.S. following its increased stake in DCP Midstream in 2023, has made emissions reduction a priority.READ MORE              Shell: Global LNG Demand To Jump 60% by 2040, Led by Asia  pgjonline.com Global demand for liquefied natural gas is estimated to rise by around 60% by 2040, driven largely by economic growth in Asia, AI impact and efforts to cut emissions in heavy industries and transportation, Shell said in an annual report on Tuesday. Demand for natural gas continues to rise globally as the world transitions to cleaner fuels. Industry forecasts LNG demand to reach between 630 million and 718 million metric tons a year by 2040, Shell said in its 2025 annual LNG outlook. The latest view from the world's largest LNG trader is higher than last year's forecast, which pegged global LNG demand in 2040 at 625 million to 685 million tons per year. \"Upgraded forecasts show that the world will need more gas for power generation, heating and cooling, industry and transport to meet development and decarbonization goals,\" said Tom Summers, Shell's senior vice president for LNG marketing and trading.READ MORE     Latest Oil Market News and Analysis for February 26  www.bloomberg.com Oil in New York steadied after sinking back into the $60s as a souring economic outlook threatened prospects for energy demand and spurred investors to shun riskier assets. WTI futures traded near $69 a barrel, after slumping 2.5% on Tuesday for the lowest close this year. A poor reading of US consumer confidence fanned concerns over the impact of President Trump’s tariffs. Crude has lost almost 5% this month as Trump’s aggressive moves on trade stoked investor anxiety at a time when oil traders were already concerned about lackluster consumption in China. Supply issues have also been at the fore, including the possibility of a restart of significant pipeline flows from Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, with the US pushing for a resumption. “Trump actions are hurting consumer and business confidence, which again will weaken actual consumption,” said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB AB.READ MORE                    Advertise | Privacy Policy       Association Revenue PartnersA JSJD Media Company500 N.

According to a White House statement, the Biden-Harris Administration dramatically slowed the growth rate of American energy production and development, including by instituting a federal oil leasing moratorium and removing hundreds of million acres from being available for energy production. Trump’s White House claims that over the past four years, it is estimated that the U.S. produced over two billion fewer barrels of oil than anticipated by trend (had President Trump’s energy policies been kept intact).READ MORE     ERCOT Approves Plan To Send Centerpoint Generators to San Antonio  www.houstonchronicle.com CenterPoint Energy’s large generators, heavily criticized for being useless in the aftermath of Hurricane Beryl, will be shipped to San Antonio for up to two years to manage grid bottlenecks in that region.
